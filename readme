This is Jingzhou Xue, Zhelin Liao, Tyler Reece's CS591 BlackJack game

run the main. it gives you a starting point.

1. main calls the BlackJack constructor to initialize a BlackJack Game
2. BlackJack constructor would take care of welcoming you to the game,
   ask your name, your desired balance, and your desired name for your
   dealer (like picking a table).Also handles switching table and end
   the whole game
3. BlackJackTable is a table or a game. It has one dealer with a deck,
   one player (could be multiple player) and their hands. It works like
   a real world casino where a dealer is in charge of dealing cards,
   shuffling the deck and splitting for the player's splittable hands.
   Table itself is in charge of game flow and game rules.
4. Deck and Hand are both lists of Card. Card contains enum Suit and
   enum FaceValue as well as its score (count as 1-13 respectively). Deck
   contains 52 cards as the poker does except for jokers. Any card game
   could easily use the Deck and Card class.
5. abstract Player and Dealer class can be used to create any card game
   player, and with the Interface Dealable and a deck of cards, the player
   could easily become a dealer. (This is good for games which dealer also
   plays a hand like a player. Otherwise, extends Dealer would be better.)
6. BJPlayer is a special Player who plays BlackJack. It has a list of hands
   since splitting a hand would give the player multiple hands. BJDealer is
   a BJPlayer with a deck of cards and some more methods to be a dealer.
   So BJDealer could play like a regular player if any other BlackJack
   game wants.
